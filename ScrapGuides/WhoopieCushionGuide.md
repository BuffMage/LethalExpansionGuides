# Whoopie Cushion Scrap Type Guide

This guide is for making `Whoopie Cushion` Type Scrap which is when a player stands on top of it, It makes a sound.

Like in previous guides if you haven't done [NormalScrapType.md](https://github.com/BuffMage/LethalExpansionGuides/blob/main/ScrapGuides/NormalScrapType.md) then do that first.

For this Guide I will be making a Fake landmine that makes an explosion sound when stepped on

## 1. Importing your Sounds

Import your sounds by dragging them into your Assets Folder. Remember your sound file should be a `wav File Format`. You can use MP3 but Lethal Company uses wav for sound files.

I recommend putting your sound files in the same folder as your Model.

For this guide I will be using `Explosion.wav`

## 2. Adding your sounds to the AssetBank

To add your sounds to your Asset Bank, go to `Templatemodassetbank` or what you called yours 

press on the drop down for `AudioClips`

Now press the `plus sign` to add a Audio Clip

Add the name of your sound and then press on the circle icon to add your sound

## 3. Adding your sounds to your Scrap

Now go to your Scrap (Where you change the properties)

Change `Normal` to `Whoopie Cushion` This will make your scrap act as a Whoopie Cushion

Scroll down till you find `Whoopie Cushion` then go to `Fart Audios`

You can press the minus `sign` to delete the fart sounds

Then Press the `Plus Sign`and add the name of your sound you made in the `AssetBank`
