# Noise Maker Scrap Type Guide

This guide is for making `NoiseMaker` Type Scrap which means your scrap will be able to make noise for example: Air Horn or Clown Horn.

This guide is assuming you have completed [ScrapNormalType](https://github.com/BuffMage/LethalExpansionGuides/blob/main/ScrapGuides/NormalScrapType.md) so if you haven't then please do that first.

## 1. Importing Sounds

Import your sounds by dragging them into your Assets Folder. Remember your sound file should be a `wav File Format`. You can use MP3 but Lethal Company uses wav for sound files.

I recommend putting your sound files in the same folder as your Model.

For the guide I will be using `Boing.wav`

## 2. Adding your sounds to your Asset Bank

First you'll go to your `Templatemodassetbank` or what ever you called it.

Press on the drop down menu for `Audio Clips`

Add the name of your `Sound File` (for example: Boing) and click on the circle icon and add your sound from there.

You will do this twice with one having `yoursoundname` and the other being `yoursoundnameFar`

## 3. Add the sounds to your Scrap

You will then go to your scrap or whatever you called it  (where you can change the properties for scrap)

Change `Normal` to `Noisemaker` so then your item will act as a Noisemaker.

Scroll down till you find `Noise SFX`

For Noise SFX put `yoursoundname` or `Boing`

Now for `Noise SFX Far` add `yoursoundnameFar` or `BoingFar`

You are able to change:
- Noise Range
- Max Loudness
- Min Loudness
- Min Pitch
- Max Pitch

## 4. Exporting


If you've done [ScrapNormalType](https://github.com/BuffMage/LethalExpansionGuides/blob/main/ScrapGuides/NormalScrapType.md)) then this should be straight forward.
